      <td class="left">This portfolio is a little different. Because hiring managers and recruiters keep asking what technologies I can use, and sometimes want proof of what I can design and build, I've designed a series of websites to showcase my varied skills.</td>

      <td class="left">How did I do that? Well, I made the same portfolio site in a variety of different languages and web technologies. One version is straight HTML, another is HTML and JavaScript, another is PHP, yet others are in C# .Net. I may also include ReactJS, Angular, and other versions, but all that takes time. I may not have that time before I get my next job.</td>

      <td class="left">Regardless what tech stack I've used, it'll be available in the dropdown list. There may be some visible differences in each version, but the background colors  should be the indicator that you have changed to a different version. Feel free to look at the source code and other aspects in your browser's developer panel. Some pages are static, some are dynamic, and some are rendered serverside, so you might not be able to tell the difference.</td>

      <td class="left">At some point, I'll have this set of sites added to my GitHub account, so you can see the design routes I've taken and code I've written. As of writing this, I don't have that set up yet.</td>
