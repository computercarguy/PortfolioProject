    <td class="text">While I was at Kaplan University, I had to create a class project.  I built the very first version of my <a href="http://IntenseComputers.com" rel="external">Intense Computers</a> website.  It is not user friendly nor is it anywhere near complete.  Since it was a final project for an HTML and JavaScript course, it didn't need to have all the pricing, just enough HTML and JavaScript to show the teacher I knew what I was doing with code.  It wasn't a design class, just a programming class.</td>
