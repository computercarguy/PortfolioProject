            <td class="text">The common advice given to beginner writers is to write what they know. It doesn't matter what that topic is, just write about it. Well, my experience is in computer, both with programming and reparing them. So I wrote this idle style game to simulate how someone could start their own software development business, but then have to deal with hackers, hardware failures, bugs, and more. It's not a 5 star game, but it's more than just a simple game, as there's a second layer of idle game inside this one. Not only do you have to "purchase" more capabilities for the different levels of software development capabilities, but you also have to purchase protection for those levels. While the first level of game produces more income for your business, the 2nd layer can take that money away. Be careful to not get put out of business by running out of money! I published this on 2 differnt sites.</td>

            <td class="text">"ScorFor" is a 3d Tic TacToe game, only you have to get 4 in a row and is based on a physical boardgame which uses pegs and beads. The Java version is a Windows based application, while the Pascal version included is the original version I wrote in 1995 and is DOS based.  I have also written a version of the game in JavaScript, using the <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/" rel="external">Raphael</a> graphics library. It took the equivalent of about 3 days of 8 hour days to build.  I rewrote it again because DOS based programs don't run on 64 bit machines, unless you have specific software, and you still have to run the Java version from a Command Prompt.  This way you can play the game from a browser.  You can get the standalone versions <a href="http://intensecomputers.com/portfolio/index.html?Page=SaU&amp;Num=1">here</a>.</td>

            <td class="text">I like to play games, expecially logic games.  This can be anything from a pure logic solver like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku" rel="external">sudoku</a>, ones that involves riddles like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo" rel="external">Clue</a>, or math based game like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuro" rel="external">kakuro</a>.  Sometimes, though, they are really tough or I get bored with them.  Also, repetition in something simple is often my first hint that it can be automated.  So here it is, a JavaScript that solves kakuro puzzles.  I am working on an expansion of this idea so that it can also solve sudoku and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futoshiki" rel="external">futoshiki</a>.</td>

            <td class="text">As I just said, I like to play games, but not when it's pure chance.  I don't play the lottery or the stock market.  Only if I cared to take the time to watch the prices would do anything with stocks.  With that in mind, I made a game to reflect how the stock market works, in a very, very, Very simplified manner.  In this game you roll some dice and you either lose or gain money.  Your score is tracked similar to a stock market ticker.  This shows you how you and any other players are doing, and how different settings you choose at the beginning of the game can dramatically change the way the game ends.  It also shows that you have next to no control over the game since it's pure chance.  I call it "Simple Stock Market," or SSM for short.</td>
