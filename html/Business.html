Most of my recent experience is in full stack development, including API programming, DB design, and various front end technologies.  Here are some business sites which I have designed and built outside of my professional positions. Some of these sites inclde their own custom content management system for the owner to modify the site without having to call me. I did testing in multiple browsers, but some of these sites are many years old and the technology has since progressed significantly.</td>

            <td class="text">I wrote this e-commerce site for myself, so people can order mid- to high- end computers online, using a visually simpler menu driven interface.  Using an interface that simply lists all the options leads to an endlessly long list that ends up causing confusion, and doesn't help the customer at all.  This needs a face lift, but it is 100% functional and it adheres to the XHTML 1.0 Transitional DTD, except for the FaceBook "Like" buttons at the bottom of the pages.</td>

She was using FrontPage&reg;, so I had to take the template she gave me and completely rewrite the site using XHTML, PHP 5, JavaScript, and CSS 2, giving it a MySQL 5.2 database for all the info she had on the site.

            <td class="text">One of my personal interests is inventing.  I have come up with ideas for new products for at least 20 years, but I haven't really done anything with those ideas.  I found the Iowa Inventors Group a few years ago and they have been helping me along with information about the invention and patent process, as well as building a business vs. licensing for the product.  In June of 2012, their webmaster decided to move on to other projects, and I took over.  This means that I didn't build the site, but I did rebuild it.  I got rid of all the junk the visual HTML editor left in, created CSS styles, edited images, removed unnecessary images, and lots of other things.  My goal was to standardized the code while changing very little of how the site looks.  Because I didn't want to leave a "mess" if I ever left the group, I didn't use PHP, but I did make the site XHTML Transitional DTD valid.  Only minimal JavaScript was used for the calendar and the Google map.</td>

            <td class="text">I have a side business I created based off my various DIY hobbies, including woodworking, metal working, laser cutting and etching, 3D printing, electronics, robotics, and more so most things aren't relevant to software development. The Christmas and birthday gifts I create all take time and effort to design and built, so I decided that I would reuse that time and learning experience to offer duplicates of those same items for sale. All my sales are either in person or through Etsy, but I wrote a basic business website to add more descriptions and pictures than Etsy gives me space for. This site also serves as a space for me to talk about current or future projects. Unfortunately, I haven't updated the content of this site since I posted it, so there's a lot of incomplete sections.</td>
